# Introduction
The repository is dedicated to tracking the latest advances in the field of Physical-Adversarial-Attack (:smiling_imp:). The maintainer will continue to update it.
# News
[2022/10/01] We have submitted our Physical-Adversarial-Attack survey on arXiv: [Physical Adversarial Attack meets Computer Vision: A Decade Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15179). (:laughing::clap:) We will continue to polish this work. (:muscle:)
